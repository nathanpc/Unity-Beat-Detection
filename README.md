# Unity Spectral Controller

A very simple way to control objects in Unity using sound.


## Usage

In order to use this library all that you have to do is attach the
`AudioProcessor` script to your `Main Camera`, and then attach the plethora
of linear and trigger controllers contained inside the `Controllers` folder
and watch as magic happens.


## Credits

This library is an expansion of the
[Unity-Beat-Detection](https://github.com/allanpichardo/Unity-Beat-Detection)
library by [allanpichardo](https://github.com/allanpichardo).
